# dot-net-design-patterns

- Practise project giving examples of Coding design patterns in C#
- We separate the patterns in following categories:
  - Creational:
    - Builder - For constructing an object piece by piece, mostly used for complex objects
    - Factory - For constructing a wholesale object, more descriptive than a regular constructor
    - Prototype - Creating an object from existing object, deep or shallow copy
    - Singleton - For creating a single instance of an object
  - Structural:
    - Adapter - Converts an interface into interface you need
    - Bridge - Composition over abstractrion
    - Composition - Uniformly treat objects and object compositions of the same type, mostly for tree like structures
    - Decorator - Extending the functionality of a certain interface without directly inheriting from it
    - Facade - Uniformed set of classes in a single interface
    - Flyweight - Space optimization technique for a big group of similar objects
    - Proxy - Used for additional checks before performing a certain functionality
  - Behavioral:
    - Chain of responsibility - Access information or process events in chain
    - Command - Encapsulate request in a single object, mostly used as a shapshot
    - Interpreter - Transforming text into an encapsulated object
    - Iterator - Providing an interface for accessing objects of an aggregate type
    - Mediator - Providing mediation between two interfaces / systems
    - Memento - For tracking system states in sequence of snapshots
    - Observer - For subscribing to a certain event, and triggering at a certain condition
    - State - For tracking states and transitions between them (state machine)
    - Strategy / Template object - For defining a blueprint of algorithm. Strategy uses composition, while TO uses inheritance
    - Visitor - adding an additional functionality to a hierarchy
